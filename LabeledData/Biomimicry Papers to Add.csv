Unearthing real-time 3D ant tunneling mechanics,"Granular excavation is the removal of solid, discrete particles from a structure composed of these objects. Efficiently predicting the stability of an excavation during particle removal is an unsolved and highly nonlinear problem, as the movement of each grain is coupled to its neighbors. Despite this, insects such as ants have evolved to be astonishingly proficient excavators, successfully removing grains such that their tunnels are stable. Currently, it is unclear how ants use their limited information about the environment to construct lasting tunnels. We attempt to unearth the ants’ tunneling algorithm by taking three-dimensional (3D) X-ray computed tomographic imaging (XRCT), in real time, of Pogonomyrmex ant tunnel construction. By capturing the location and shape of each grain in the domain, we characterize the relationship between particle properties and ant decision-making within an accurate, virtual recreation of the experiment. We discover that intergranular forces decrease significantly around ant tunnels due to arches forming within the soil. Due to this force relaxation, any grain the ants pick from the tunnel surface will likely be under low stress. Thus, ants avoid removing grains compressed under high forces without needing to be aware of the force network in the surrounding material. Even more, such arches shield tunnels from high forces, providing tunnel robustness. Finally, we observe that ants tend to dig piecewise linearly downward. These results are a step toward understanding granular tunnel stability in heterogeneous 3D systems. We expect that such findings may be leveraged for robotic excavation.",10.1073/pnas.2102267118,https://www.pnas.org/content/118/36/e2102267118,,,,,,,Y,,,,FALSE
Interacting Gears Synchronize Propulsive Leg Movements in a Jumping Insect,"Gears are found rarely in animals and have never been reported to intermesh and rotate functionally like mechanical gears. We now demonstrate functional gears in the ballistic jumping movements of the flightless planthopper insect Issus. The nymphs, but not adults, have a row of cuticular gear (cog) teeth around the curved medial surfaces of their two hindleg trochantera. The gear teeth on one trochanter engaged with and sequentially moved past those on the other trochanter during the preparatory cocking and the propulsive phases of jumping. Close registration between the gears ensured that both hindlegs moved at the same angular velocities to propel the body without yaw rotation. At the final molt to adulthood, this synchronization mechanism is jettisoned.",10.1126/science.1240284,https://www.science.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1240284,,,,,,,Y,,,,FALSE
